## About the App

This app aims to track the bugs faced when completing a project. This would help users to be able to keep track of the issues that they encounter so that they can refer to it whenever they face the same problem. Also, users are able to show the problem and how they managed to solve it. It is otherwise known as an Bug Tracker.

## Technologies used

Rails Fullstack Webpacker

-  ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, PostgreSQL

## Approach

I found myself having to refer to the Stackoverflow forum often to find issues to resolve. Therefore, I created this app so that I could record the issues that I faced and refer to it so that I can learn from it. I started out with a wireframe and an ERD diagram which helps me to see clearly the functions that I would want in my app.

## Installation 

` bundle install`

`rails db:create`

`rails db:migrate`
